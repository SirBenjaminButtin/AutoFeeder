// Variables to store user inputs
    // User input for feeding time
    // User input for number of turns per feeding
    // Initial amount of food, assuming it's a percentage

// Function to set feeding time


// Function to set turns per feeding


// Function to dispense food

        // Calculate the amount of food to dispense based on turnsPerFeeding
             // You need to determine the appropriate constant
        
        // Update the remaining food
        

        // Dispense the food
        // Code to control the feeder and dispense food
        
        // Log the dispensed amount and remaining food
        

// Function to check the current time and trigger feeding if it's the set feeding time
     // You need to implement this function to get the current time
   

// Main loop
    // Other tasks or sleep for some time before checking again
